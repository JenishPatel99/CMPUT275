CMPUT 275 is a 2/2 part of the CMPUT 274/275 course package. The content of the courses outlines the advance topics into C++ programming, algorithms, data structures and basic embedded code. Here I have code that briefly speaks about my level of skill when it comes to programming. This is merely my way of showing my work and I would welcome individuals who may want to edit, comment or give further advice.
