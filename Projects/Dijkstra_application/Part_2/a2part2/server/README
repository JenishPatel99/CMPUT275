	* digraph.cpp
	* digraph.h
	* dijkstra.cpp
	* dijkstra.h

Included Files client:
	* client.cpp
	* consts_and_types.h
	* draw_route.cpp
	* draw_route.h
	* instructions.txt
	* lcd_image.cpp
	* lcd_image.h
	* Makefile
	* map_drawing.cpp
	* map_drawing.h
	* README
	* serial_handling.cpp
	* serial_handling.h

Accessories:
	* Arduino Mega 2560
	* Arduino compatible TFT display
	* Two push buttons
	* multiple M to M wires
	* serial cable connecting arduino to computer

Wiring Instructions for client:

	* Mount the TFT display on the Arduino just like with Assignment 1

	* Joystick (same as with assignment 1)
	  VRx <--> A8
	  VRy <--> A9
	  SW  <--> Digital Pin 53
	  GND <--> GND
	  +5V <--> 5V

	  Two pushbuttons for zoom. They are initialized in the code with internal pullup
	  resistors. So for each, one side is connected to GND and the other to a digital
	  pin.

	  Zoom Out Button <--> Digital Pin 47
	  Zoom In Button  <--> Digital Pin 45

Wiring Instructions for server:
	* None

Makefile Targets for client:
	* "make" : links all objects files and creates an executable
	* "dijkstra.o" : compiles dijkstra.cpp
	* "server.o" : compiles server.cpp
	* "digraph.o" : compiles digraph.cpp
	* "clean" : removes the object and executable

Makefile Targets for server:
	* None

Running Instructions Combined:
	To run the client simply use the "arduino-port-select" command in the terminal of the client directory. 
	Press "1" twice. Then type make upload and it should upload the program to the arduino. For the server
	side it is slightly more complex. Only AFTER the client program is uploaded to the arduino call
	"g++ server -o server" in the server directory. Then call the exectuable "./server", the screen of the
	arduino should flash blue then reload. Then press at the "Ctrl-C", and then call the exectuable server
	"./server" again. We find if you don't do this it tends not to work, that is calling the exectuable,
	pressing ctrl-c and calling the exectuable again. 


Notes and Assumptions:
	Code was implemented to the best of our ability and to the best of our understanding
	from the description. We took the wiring instructions directly from the "instructions.txt"
	given to us in the client directory. Besides this please read the wiring instructions carefully
	making sure to call the exectuable once, ctrl-c and then call it again.
