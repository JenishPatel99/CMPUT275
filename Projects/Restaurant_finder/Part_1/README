Major Assignment: Restaurant Finder Part 1

Included Files:
	* a1part1.cpp
	* a1part1.h
	* README
	* Makefile
	* lcd_image.h
	* lcd_image.cpp

Accessories:
	* 1x Arduino MEGA 2560 Board
	* 1x USB Cable
	* 1x 3.5" TFT LCD 480x320 Arduino Touch Screen
	* 5x Breadboard M/F Male-to-Female Jumper Wires
	* 1x Joystick Module
	* 1x Formatted Kingston 8/16GB Micro SD card SDHC Class 10 UHS-I microSDHC Card

Wiring Instructions:
	* Arduino analog pin A8 should connect to joystick VRy( requires bending of pin with TFT display installed )
	* Arduino analog pin A9 should connect to joystick VRx( requires bending of pin with TFT display installed )
	* Arduino digital pin 53 should connect to joystick pin SW
	* Arduino GND connect to GND joystick pin
	* Arduino 5v connect to 5v joystick pin
	* Install TFT display onto Arduino Mega Board

Running Instructions:
	1. Connect Arduino to the PC using A-B style USB cable. Ensure
	that the Arduino is using the proper serial port 

	2. In the directory containing the files a1part1.cpp, a1part.h and
	Makefile, use the command "make upload" to upload the code 
	the the Arduino for testing. 

Notes and Assumptions:
	Code was implemented to the best of our ability and to the best of our understanding
	from the description. The getRestaurantFast() was taken directly from Mattheas Jamieson's
	Weekly Excercise. As well as other snippets of code was used from examples discussed in
	class and from the description of the assignment.

	Most of our code was built upon weekly exercise 1 and 2, so many functions were taken from those cpp files.
