Final Project: Pong

Included Files server:
	* main.cpp
	* EEPROM.h
	* pong.h
	* paddle.h
	* Metro.h
	* Metro.cpp
	* const_and_lib.h
	* Makefile
	* README

Accessories:
	* Arduino Mega 2560
	* Arduino compatible TFT display
	* multiple M to M wires
	* serial cable connecting arduino to computer

Wiring Instructions:

	* Mount the TFT display on the Arduino

	* Joystick
	  VRx <--> A8
	  VRy <--> A9
	  SW  <--> Digital Pin 53
	  GND <--> GND
	  +5V <--> 5V

Running Instructions:
	 Start by ensuring that all files are in your chosen directory. Open the terminal and execute "make". This is compile
	 the code (No errors are expected). Then "make upload" command will start the serial communication between the computer
	 and the arduino.

	 The game is very intuitive. The user can start the game by pressing button using stylus. A new screen will pop and it will
	 ask for player 1 and player 2 initials. These initials will be stored in the Arduino, the data will not be removed if the
	 arduino is turned off. This was done using the EEPROM library. The next screen is the instructions menu which will direct
	 you with the rules.

	 Once in the gameplay screen, a player may use the keyboard or the joystick to move the paddle up and down. The keys "w" and
	 "s" will move the left paddle up and down. In this scenario, the left paddle will be on the side of the screen which is close
	 to the USB communication. The keyboard method was an alternative method used because we were not able to do the serial communication
	 between two Arduinos.   


Notes and Assumptions:
	Code was implemented to the best of our ability and to the best of our understanding
	from the description. The leaderboard is saved in the eeprom of the arduino. The top
	three scores are saved along with their intials which totals 9 bytes. In order this
	is the initals of the top score, followed by its score. The initals of second highest
	score, followed by the score, and lastly by the initals of the third highest score, and
	then followed by the score.
