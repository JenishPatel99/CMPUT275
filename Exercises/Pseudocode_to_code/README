Weekly Assignment: Pseudocode to code

Included Files:
	* flipflop.cpp
	* textmath.cpp
	* Makefile (Custom)
	* README

Accessories:
	* None required

Wiring instructions: 
	* None required

Running instructions:
	1. Download the pseudocode.tar.gz and extract the folder into desired directory
	2. Use make 'specified target' to excute desired commands.
	3. You can also interact with the two programs via terminal, due to nature of assignment
	   no protection is there for inputs in terminal.
	   a) For flipflop program
	   	- The first input is the length of array
	   	- The second input is the elements of the array
	   b) For textmatch program
	   	- Both, first and second inputs are arrays

Makefile Targets:
		* "make flipflop" links corresponding object to executable flipflop
		* "make flipflop.o" compiles flipflop.cpp to create object file
		* "make textmatch" links corresponding object to executable textmatch
		* "make textmatch.o" compiles textmatch.cpp to create object file



General overview:
	The program adapts two pseudocodes to create two c++ programs. The programs can be ran through test cases given in eclass to see if program excute properly.
